# Documentation Index

> **Status:** STABLE · **Owner:** Platform Architecture · **Updated:** 2026-10-27

This is the authoritative documentation set for the Universal Business ERP Platform
("the Platform"). Documentation is the product blueprint: implementation phases consume
it, and implementation evidence updates it. All documents are written in English; the
product itself is Arabic-first with full English support.

**Document header convention.** Every document starts with a status line:
`> **Status:** STABLE | DRAFT | PROPOSED`. `STABLE` documents may only change through the
change-control process in [handoff/IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md](handoff/IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md).

## Reading order (for a new engineer or AI agent)

0. **Consolidated authoritative layer (2026-10-28):** start at
   [ARCHITECTURE_BASELINE.md](ARCHITECTURE_BASELINE.md) — the single authoritative summary of
   the selected architecture — then [ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_REGISTER.md](ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_REGISTER.md)
   and the domain summaries below. These documents consolidate the baseline and absorb the
   audited best of the competing plans; traceability lives in
   [CONSOLIDATION_REGISTER.md](CONSOLIDATION_REGISTER.md) and verification results in
   [CONSOLIDATION_VALIDATION_REPORT.md](CONSOLIDATION_VALIDATION_REPORT.md).
1. [PROJECT_VISION.md](PROJECT_VISION.md) — what we are building and for whom.
2. [SCOPE_AND_NON_GOALS.md](SCOPE_AND_NON_GOALS.md) — what we are explicitly NOT building.
3. [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) — controlled vocabulary (English ↔ Arabic). All other documents use these terms.
4. [architecture/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](architecture/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md) and [architecture/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md](architecture/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md).
5. [planning/MASTER_ROADMAP.md](planning/MASTER_ROADMAP.md) — the 25 phases.
6. [handoff/AGENT_START_HERE.md](handoff/AGENT_START_HERE.md) — how to execute a phase.

| [ARCHITECTURE_RISKS_AND_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md](ARCHITECTURE_RISKS_AND_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md) | Unresolved decisions, assumptions, risks |

| [localization/REGIONAL_TAX_AND_COMPLIANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md](localization/REGIONAL_TAX_AND_COMPLIANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md) | Country packs, tax engine boundaries, e-invoicing |
| [industries/INDUSTRY_MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md](industries/INDUSTRY_MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md) | Core vs optional modules, industry templates |
| [ui/UNIFIED_UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](ui/UNIFIED_UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) | Shared design system across web/desktop/Android |
| [reporting/REPORTING_AND_DOCUMENT_ENGINE.md](reporting/REPORTING_AND_DOCUMENT_ENGINE.md) | Reports, printing, document generation, reconciliation |
| [offline/OFFLINE_AND_SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md](offline/OFFLINE_AND_SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md) | Platforms, local storage, sync, conflict resolution |
| [planning/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](planning/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) | Consolidated 25-phase roadmap with effort bands and deltas |

These documents **summarize and bind**; the detailed domain documents listed below remain
the normative source for their scope. Where a consolidated document and a detail document
conflict without a recorded DEF/CD correction, file a defect — do not silently pick one.

## Cross-reference rules

1. Link to documents with relative Markdown links (e.g., `../accounting/POSTING_ENGINE.md`).
2. Phases are referenced as `PHASE-001` … `PHASE-025` (three digits, hyphenated).
3. Architecture decisions are referenced as `ADR-0001` … `ADR-0016`.
4. Accounting invariants are referenced as `INV-001` … (see `accounting/ACCOUNTING_INVARIANTS.md`).
5. Business rules are referenced as `BR-xxx` (see `product/BUSINESS_RULES.md`).
6. Feature keys follow `module.feature_name` (see `product/FEATURE_CATALOG.md`).
7. Requirements are referenced as `FR-<AREA>-nnn` (see `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md`).
8. Risks are referenced as `RISK-nnn` (see `planning/RISK_REGISTER.md`).

## Change control

Documentation changes that affect architecture, accounting rules, security, compliance,
or phase scope require an ADR or decision record plus a `CHANGELOG.md` entry. See
[handoff/IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md](handoff/IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md).
