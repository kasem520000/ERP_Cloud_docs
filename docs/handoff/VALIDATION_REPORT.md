# Blueprint Validation Report

> **Status:** STABLE · **Owner:** Platform Architecture · **Validation date:** 2026-10-27

Record of the cross-document validation performed on blueprint v1.0 (directive STEP 9),
re-runnable via `scripts/validate_docs.py` (wired into CI in PHASE-001). This report is
re-run and appended after every phase that changes documentation.

## 1. Automated checks (script: `scripts/validate_docs.py`)

| Check | Method | Result (v1.0) |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Required inventory (166 required paths from directive §18 structure) | File existence | PASS — all present (202 total markdown files; the first validation pass recorded 201 —
recount corrected this **DEF-009**; post-consolidation inventory lives in
[../CONSOLIDATION_VALIDATION_REPORT.md](../CONSOLIDATION_VALIDATION_REPORT.md)) |
| ADR completeness | ≥ 16 ADR files | PASS — 16 |
| Phase documents | 25 files × 8 mandatory sections + status header + ≥ 200 lines | PASS — 25/25 (exemplars 001/002 expanded; agent-written phases 300–450 lines) |
| Phase-reference consistency | Roadmap + dependency graph + acceptance criteria + status reference all PHASE-001…025 (any notation form) | PASS |
| Link resolution | Every relative link resolves to an existing file | PASS — 0 broken (14 found and fixed in v1.0 review pass: wrong relative depths, missing VALIDATION_REPORT, stale ERD→TABLES pointers) |
| Mermaid/code fences | Balanced code fences (triple-backtick); mermaid blocks well-formed | PASS — 60 diagrams |
| Stub markers | Placeholder-marker scan (quotes-aware) | PASS (two false-positives reviewed: "coming soon" is legitimate onboarding UI copy; INV-000123 examples are invoice numbers, not invariant IDs — check refined) |
| Registry integrity | INV-001…022, BR-001…040, RISK-001…022 referenced anywhere are defined in their registries | PASS — 22 invariants (referenced across 23 docs), 40 rules, 22 risks |
| Terminology spot checks | banned bigserial column specs, common misspellings | PASS — zero occurrences in type positions (uppercase BIGSERIAL appears only in ADR-0006's rejected-alternatives table) |
| Status headers | Every living doc carries a Status line | PASS |

## 2. Manual consistency review performed (v1.0)

| Area | Review | Resolution |
|------|--------|------------|
| Phase-numbering drift | Subagent cross-reports flagged: ADR-0012 (POS subset), DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE (client phases), OQ-004 (ZATCA phase), OBSERVABILITY (sync health phase), MODULE_BOUNDARIES (configuration module phase + sync tables) | All corrected to roadmap canon: POS=016, sync=020, desktop=021, android=022, ZATCA impl=023, configuration engine=015 |
| Permission-key drift | FEATURE_CATALOG permission column vs AUTHORIZATION_MATRIX (POS/template/BOM/settlement/device keys) | Normative reconciliation note added to FEATURE_CATALOG: AUTHORIZATION_MATRIX is canonical; phases must reconcile in-PR |
| 29-items vs 8-sections | Directive §19 lists 29 mandatory items; template renders 8 sections | Mapping table added to implementation/README.md; template comment corrected — all 29 items covered, CI-validated |
| PHASE_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md | File was found missing during the build (write anomaly) | Re-authored and verified present; referenced consistently by roadmap, protocol, and phases |
| Dangling spec pointer | E_INVOICING_ARCHITECTURE → TABLES/tax-compliance.md | File created (tax/compliance column specs); ERD pointers corrected to the per-phase TABLES sync rule |
| Directive STEP-9 checklist | Contradictory decisions / missing prerequisites / undefined terms / inconsistent entity names / missing relationships / missing authorization / missing accounting effects / unsupported regulatory claims / circular phase dependencies / features without tests / reports without sources / offline workflows without conflict policies / modules without ownership | Each verified: decisions in ADRs + decisions/; prerequisites per phase doc §3; glossary defines terms; entity names catalog-driven; relationships + write-matrix in database/MODULE_BOUNDARIES docs; authorization matrix covers modules; posting rules cover every operation (POSTING_ENGINE §4 + ACCOUNTING_TESTS golden tests); compliance claims all carry REQUIRES_VERIFICATION (no unsupported claims); dependency graph acyclic (script-verified structure); every feature maps to phases with acceptance criteria; every report in REPORT_CATALOG has a source-of-truth; offline operations carry per-entity conflict policies; every module has owned tables + published services |

## 3. Residual known limitations (honest statement)

1. Tax rates and regulatory statuses are BASELINE_RESEARCH only — every compliance
   fact carries REQUIRES_VERIFICATION + official source; verification occurs in
   PHASE-009 (packs) and PHASE-023 (integrations). No compliance claim is made.
2. Plan limits/pricing are PLACEHOLDER pending OQ-002; payment provider pending OQ-003;
   ZATCA scope pending OQ-004 / DR-001. All are decision records, none block phases.
3. TABLES/ specs exist for tenancy-identity, core-accounting, and tax-compliance;
   remaining clusters (trade/inventory/treasury) intentionally land per-phase per the
   database README sync rule (no speculative columns — directive §23 STEP 4).
4. Docs describe a **designed** system: nothing is implemented, tested, or verified
   until phases complete with evidence (see CURRENT_STATE.md).

## 4. Re-validation protocol

- `scripts/validate_docs.py` must exit 0 in CI (PHASE-001 wires it).
- Every phase completion report must include a re-run of the script + a line here (or a
  linked delta) if it found and fixed issues.
- Manual review checklist (§2) is re-run when any ADR, roadmap edge, or phase scope
  changes.
