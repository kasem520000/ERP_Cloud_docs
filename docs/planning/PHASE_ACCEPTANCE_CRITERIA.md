# Phase Acceptance Criteria

> **Status:** STABLE · **Owner:** Platform Architecture · **Updated:** 2026-10-28

Consolidated, objective acceptance criteria and exit gates per phase. The authoritative,
expanded version lives in each phase document's sections 6–8 ("Verification",
"Completion and Handoff"); this file is the reviewable index. **No phase may be marked
COMPLETE unless every item here passes with evidence.**

Universal criteria apply to all phases (from
[../testing/TEST_STRATEGY.md](../testing/TEST_STRATEGY.md) and
[../handoff/IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md](../handoff/IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md)):

- U1. Typecheck, lint (incl. module-boundary rules), and full test suite green in CI.
- U2. New migrations apply cleanly on a fresh database AND on the staging-shape database
  (migration test); rollback path documented.
- U3. Every new tenant-owned table has tenant scoping + RLS + isolation attack tests.
- U4. Every new route has permission checks + permission tests; rate limits on public ones.
- U5. All money math via shared decimal utilities; no float (lint-enforced).
- U6. UI text bilingual (AR+EN), RTL-correct (visual snapshot AR & EN), a11y checks pass.
- U7. Documentation updated: [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md),
  affected domain docs, `CHANGELOG.md`; completion report written with evidence.
- U8. No TODOs / stubs / dead code merged; code review checklist passed.

## Per-phase criteria — Blueprint v2.0 expansion (stages 9–11)

Universal criteria U1–U8 above apply unchanged, as do the register §O safeguards: every
new posting goes through the posting engine with INV-013 idempotency, every new table is
tenant-owned + RLS with isolation attack tests, and no country-specific rates are
fabricated. Canonical identifiers per [../EXPANSION_REGISTER.md](../EXPANSION_REGISTER.md).

### PHASE-026 — Fixed Assets & Depreciation

- **INV-023 enforced**: Σ depreciation ≤ cost − salvage_value; NBV ≥ 0 always; disposal
  once only and only from status ACTIVE/FULLY_DEPRECIATED.
- Goldens **G-21/G-22/G-23** byte-stable: capitalization; monthly depreciation run (one
  journal, lines per asset); disposal with mandatory gain/loss mirror.
- Depreciation posts **only via runs** (BR-042), and runs are period-locked; a manual asset
  journal is rejected (negative test).
- Disposal locks the asset (BR-043); revaluation is optional + audited with delta to
  `REVALUATION_RESERVE` (BR-044).
- **Category purpose mapping enforced fail-closed** (BR-041): asset/accumulated/expense
  purposes must exist before a category is usable.
- Asset register, depreciation schedule, and movements reports reconcile to GL control
  accounts on golden datasets.
- All 6 new tables (`asset_categories`, `assets`, `depreciation_runs`, `depreciation_lines`
  🔒, `asset_disposals`, `asset_revaluations`) tenant-owned + RLS + isolation attack tests.

### PHASE-027 — Cheques, Promissory Notes & Installments

- **INV-024 enforced**: note custody equals journal effects — COLLECTED/DISCOUNTED/RETURNED
  notes carry zero `NOTES_RECEIVABLE` balance.
- Goldens **G-24…G-28** byte-stable: note received against invoice; collected at maturity;
  dishonored; issued-note pair; installment late fee.
- **PDC calendar auto-derived** from note maturity dates (BR-045); endorsement moves
  custody without a journal (BR-047).
- **Dishonor restores the AR open item exactly** (amount + references), requires a reason;
  bank fee optional via `BANK_CHARGES` (BR-046).
- **Installment plan total = source document total** (BR-048); schedule immutable after
  activation; **late fees only via the engine** per plan policy (BR-049/G-28), flat fees
  only — no interest-bearing computation (DR-003).
- Maturity-calendar, aging, and dishonored-register reports correct on golden datasets.
- `notes`, `note_events` 🔒, `installment_plans`, `installment_lines` tenant-owned + RLS +
  isolation attack tests; existing `treasury.cheques` feature key re-pointed to the
  `notes` module (ED-03).

### PHASE-028 — Budgeting & Variance Control

- **One ACTIVE budget version per (fiscal year, scope)** (BR-050); revisions supersede —
  never edit (immutability test).
- **Budgets never post journals**: budget lines are planning data only; variance reads GL
  actuals (negative test: no journal can originate from budgeting).
- **Controls advisory by default** (BR-051); hard-block only via explicit tenant policy;
  both behaviors tested.
- Budget-vs-actual variance correct on golden datasets across all four scopes (accounts,
  cost centers, projects, branches).
- Approval workflow DRAFT → PENDING_APPROVAL → ACTIVE → REVISED/CLOSED with SoD on
  `budgeting.budgets.approve`.
- `budgets`, `budget_lines` tenant-owned + RLS + isolation attack tests.

### PHASE-029 — Payroll: Salaries, Loans & End-of-Service

- **INV-025 enforced**: run totals = Σ lines (gross, deductions, net) and net = gross −
  deductions exactly; posted runs immutable (reversal-only).
- Goldens **G-29/G-30/G-31** byte-stable: run posting; payout; EOS settlement with residual
  to `EOS_PROVISION_EXPENSE`.
- **Payroll posts only via runs** (BR-053): a manual journal touching payroll accounts is
  rejected (negative test).
- **PII permission gating**: `payroll.employees.*` reads restricted (role template
  additions); national-ID and bank fields protected per
  [../security/DATA_PROTECTION.md](../security/DATA_PROTECTION.md).
- **No fabricated rates** (BR-055): components are tenant-configured; GOSI/social-insurance/EOS
  jurisdiction rules REQUIRE_VERIFICATION per the official-sources protocol; EOS accrual
  per tenant policy table.
- Salary structure versioning (BR-052): mid-period change creates a new structure version;
  loan deduction per period ≤ cap percent of net (BR-054).
- All 7 payroll tables (`employees`, `salary_structures`, `salary_components`,
  `payroll_runs`, `payroll_run_lines` 🔒, `employee_loans`, `employee_loan_lines`)
  tenant-owned + RLS + isolation attack tests.

### PHASE-030 — Wholesale & Electronics Templates

- `manifest.wholesale.json` + `manifest.electronics.json` parse, schema-validate, and
  extract byte-stable (`industry.wholesale`, `industry.electronics` ids).
- Both template docs pass the industry framework's **7 governance tests** (manifest schema,
  feature-key existence, navigation sample, terminology overrides, workflow signature,
  defaults, out-of-scope declaration).
- **Additive switching rules hold**: applying either template to a live tenant is
  additive-only; destructive attempts rejected + audited (INV-022 fuzz extended).
- Wholesale: qty-break price lists, credit terms/limits, optional routes resolve on golden
  partner/item data.
- Electronics: IMEI serial tracking, repair service orders, POS keys, trade-in via
  purchasing — every flagship key resolves to an existing module feature (no new core
  surface).
- CAPABILITY_MATRIX gains WHL/ELC columns; every cell cites an existing feature or N/A.

### PHASE-031 — Healthcare Commercial Shell

- Manifest + template doc pass the **7 governance tests**; additive switching rules hold.
- Insurance-claim billing = AR per claim (no clinical data model); claim lifecycle tested;
  claims cheques via `notes.received`.
- Pharmacy stock = `inventory.batch_tracking` (+ expiry) verified on golden datasets; no
  drug/clinical catalog fabricated.
- Patient financial files = partner extension with financial data only — clinical records/HIS
  remain out-of-scope, declared in the template doc (ED-11).
- Visits via `crm.service_orders`; every flagship key resolves to an existing feature.
- CAPABILITY_MATRIX gains the HLT column and `insurance_claim_billing` row with citations.

### PHASE-032 — Education Commercial Shell

- Manifest + template doc pass the **7 governance tests**; additive switching rules hold.
- Tuition contracts via `crm.service_contracts` (enrollment years); installment plans via
  `installments.plans` — plan total = contract total (BR-048) tested on golden data.
- Sibling discounts via pricing rules (no new pricing engine surface); dunning uses
  installment aging.
- Academic operations/LMS remain out-of-scope, declared in the template doc (ED-11).
- CAPABILITY_MATRIX gains the EDU column and `installment_terms` row with citations.

### PHASE-033 — Agriculture Commercial Shell

- Manifest + template doc pass the **7 governance tests**; additive switching rules hold.
- Crop-cycle costing via `manufacturing.boms` + production costing verified on golden
  datasets (crop cycle = BOM: inputs → harvest).
- Harvest batches via `inventory.batch_tracking`; livestock as serial-tracked items (no new
  tracking primitives).
- Per-field costing via `accounting.projects` — project dimension tested on agri documents.
- Precision agronomy remains out-of-scope, declared in the template doc (ED-11).
- CAPABILITY_MATRIX gains the AGR column and `crop_cycle_costing`/`harvest_batches` rows
  with citations.

### PHASE-034 — Multi-Entity Consolidation

- **INV-026 enforced**: consolidation runs never write member books; consolidated
  statement = Σ member statements (group currency, dated FX) − eliminations.
- **Zero cross-tenant writes**: cross-tenant reads only via the explicit, audited,
  read-only service (ADR-0018); RLS never relaxed — proven by isolation attack tests.
- Eliminations are balanced journals posted only in the parent's consolidation books
  (golden **G-32** byte-stable); reversible only by counter-entry (BR-056).
- **Member periods closed** prerequisite (BR-056) enforced and tested — a run against an
  open member period is rejected.
- Consolidated TB/IS/BS + eliminations log reconcile to member books on a golden
  two-entity dataset with intercompany balances.
- FX translation uses dated rates from PHASE-007; ownership percentages recorded on
  `group_entities`.
- `consolidation_groups`, `group_entities`, `elimination_entries`, `consolidation_runs`
  tenant-owned + RLS + isolation attack tests.

### Enterprise Depth release gate (end of PHASE-034)

- Every stage 9–11 phase (026–034) is `COMPLETE` with evidence per this file.
- Consolidated statements reconcile to member books with eliminations proven (INV-026,
  golden G-32); zero cross-tenant writes demonstrated (ADR-0018).
- Payroll, fixed-assets, and notes/installments suites green (INV-023…025, goldens
  G-21…G-32).
- Stages 9–11 never alter the MVP (PHASE-014) or GA (PHASE-025) gate criteria (ED-01) —
  expansion evidence is additional, never a substitute.

## Verification evidence requirements

Every acceptance item must be evidenced by at least one of: CI test names (linked),
command output in the completion report, screenshots for visual criteria (secondary —
data assertions are primary per directive §17), or runbook drill logs. Statements
without evidence do not count. A phase with failing or skipped critical tests is
`IN_PROGRESS` — never `COMPLETE`.
