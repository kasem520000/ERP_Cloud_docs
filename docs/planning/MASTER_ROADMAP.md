# Master Roadmap

> **Status:** STABLE · **Owner:** Platform Architecture · **Updated:** 2026-10-28

The dependency-driven implementation roadmap: **34 phases in 11 stage groups** — stages 1–8
are the v1.1 baseline; stages 9–11 are the Blueprint v2.0 post-GA expansion
([../EXPANSION_REGISTER.md](../EXPANSION_REGISTER.md)). Detailed,
actionable phase documents (29 mandatory sections each) live in
[../implementation/phases/](../implementation/phases/). Every phase's full acceptance
criteria are consolidated in [PHASE_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md](PHASE_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md);
current progress in [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md).

**Reading rule for implementers:** the phase document is authoritative; this roadmap is
the index. If they conflict, the phase document wins and this file must be corrected.

## Stage groups

| Stage | Name | Phases | Outcome |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Foundation & Platform | 001–004 | Repo, database infrastructure, identity/tenancy/audit, tenant provisioning + platform admin |
| 2 | Experience Layer | 005 | Design system, i18n/RTL foundation, app shell |
| 3 | Financial Core | 006–009 | Master data, accounting core + posting engine, treasury, tax engine + jurisdiction packs |
| 4 | Supply & Trade Operations | 010–012 | Inventory & warehousing, purchasing & payables, sales & receivables |
| 5 | Insight & Commercial Launch — **MVP** | 013–014 | Reporting/printing engine, subscriptions & billing & onboarding → **MVP release** |
| 6 | Industry Expansion | 015–019 | Industry framework + priority templates, POS, automotive/distribution templates, manufacturing, CRM |
| 7 | Offline & Multi-Platform | 020–022 | Sync foundation, desktop application, Android application |
| 8 | Integrations & Enterprise Readiness — **GA** | 023–025 | E-invoicing implementations + external adapters, security hardening, performance & GA readiness |
| 9 | Financial Depth | 026–029 | Fixed assets, cheques/notes/installments, budgeting, payroll |
| 10 | Industry Expansion II | 030–033 | Wholesale, electronics, healthcare, education, agriculture templates |

## Release gates

### MVP gate (end of PHASE-014)

- A real business can: register → onboard → configure CoA → record opening balances →
  buy (PO→GRN→invoice) → sell (order→delivery→invoice→receipt) → count stock → close a
  period → print financial statements + VAT return — in Arabic and English.
- All accounting invariants tested; tenant isolation attack suite green; backups
  configured and a restore rehearsed once in staging; subscription billing operational
  (provider + manual fallback); security review of MVP surface complete.
- Exit evidence per [PHASE_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md](PHASE_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md) §14.

### GA gate (end of PHASE-025)

- Load tests at 10× projected traffic meet NFR-006; DR drill completed within RTO;
  restore-from-backup proven; pen-test findings closed; runbooks validated; error
  budget process live; ZATCA adapter (if in scope for KSA launch segment) certified per
  official requirements — or the launch segment explicitly excludes e-invoicing-requiring
  taxpayers (documented decision).

### Enterprise Depth gate (end of PHASE-034)

- Consolidated statements reconcile to member books: consolidated TB/IS/BS = Σ member
  statements (group currency, dated FX) − eliminations (INV-026, golden G-32).
- Eliminations proven: every elimination is a balanced journal posted only in the
  parent's consolidation books, reversible only by counter-entry (BR-056); zero
  cross-tenant writes (ADR-0018).
- Payroll, fixed-assets, and notes/installments suites green (INV-023…INV-025, goldens
  G-21…G-31) — stage-9 depth runs on the proven GA core.
- Exit evidence per [PHASE_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md](PHASE_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md) §026–034.

## Sequencing rationale (key decisions)

1. **Tax engine (P-009) BEFORE purchasing/sales (P-011/012)**: invoices must carry tax
   treatments from their first version; retrofitting tax lines into posted documents is
   impossible (immutability).
2. **Treasury (P-008) before sales/purchasing**: receipts/payments are consumed by both
   trade modules; partners' opening balances need AR/AP subledger + control accounts
   which exist after P-007.
3. **Reporting engine (P-013) after trade modules**: statements must reconcile to real
   transactional data, not stubs; but report *contract* foundation is defined in docs now
   and consumed progressively (financial statement needs only P-007 data — PHASE-013
   builds the engine, with earlier phases providing data).
4. **POS (P-016) after MVP**: POS needs the industry framework and a scoped offline
   queue; forcing it into MVP would delay the commercial launch for a segment that can
   launch with back-office invoicing.
5. **Offline sync foundation (P-020) generalized AFTER POS**: POS ships a narrowly
   scoped, documented offline queue (P-016) as the first real consumer; the generalized
   protocol (P-020) then abstracts it — this avoids designing sync in the abstract.
6. **E-invoicing implementation (P-023) last**: requires verified official
   specifications, credentials, and certification paths that must not be fabricated;
   the architecture (adapters) is ready from P-009, so implementation is isolated.
7. **Financial-depth modules (P-026…029) after GA**: they extend a proven core — every
   new posting flows through the same posting engine, invariants, and golden datasets
   (ED-01); building them before GA would delay the commercial launch for depth that
   early customers do not need yet.
8. **Commercial shells (P-030…033) before deep verticals** (ED-11): configuration-layer
   templates over existing modules ship industry value fast without new core surface;
   deep-vertical operations (clinical HIS, academic LMS, agronomy science) wait for
   explicit decision records.
9. **Consolidation last (P-034)**: it reads everything — member books, dated FX,
   fixed-asset and payroll data — so it lands after the modules it consumes and closes
   stage 11 with the Enterprise Depth gate.

## Scope discipline rules

- A phase may pull scope **forward** from a later phase only via a decision record that
  also moves the later phase's scope explicitly.
- No phase implements beyond its document; "while I'm here" changes are code-review
  blockers ([../implementation/templates/CODE_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md](../implementation/templates/CODE_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md)).
- Every phase ends with updated [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md),
  a completion report with evidence, and `CHANGELOG.md` entries.
- **Stages 9–11 (PHASE-026…034) are additive post-GA releases**
  ([../EXPANSION_REGISTER.md](../EXPANSION_REGISTER.md), ED-01): they may never alter the
  MVP (PHASE-014) or GA (PHASE-025) gate criteria, and no expansion scope may be pulled
  backward into stages 1–8.
