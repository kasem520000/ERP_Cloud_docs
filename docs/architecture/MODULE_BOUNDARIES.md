# Module Boundaries

> **Status:** STABLE · **Owner:** Platform Architecture · **Updated:** 2026-10-28

The authoritative module (bounded context) catalog. Modules live in `apps/api/src/modules/`
as NestJS modules with a strict internal layout (`api/` = published surface,
`application/`, `domain/`, `infrastructure/`). Enforcement is described in
[DEPENDENCY_RULES.md](DEPENDENCY_RULES.md); the shared-kernel contents in ADR-0002.

## Cross-module write matrix (normative)

Only these cross-module writes exist — everything else is a published-service call:

| Table(s) | Written exclusively by |
|----------|----------------------|
| `journal_entries`, `journal_lines` | `accounting` (posting engine) — nobody else, ever |
| `stock_moves`, `stock_layers` | `inventory` |
| `partners*`, `items*` | `partners`, `items` |
| `audit_events` | `audit` module interceptor (never direct inserts from modules) |
| `cash_accounts`/`bank_accounts` balances | `treasury` (through posting engine for GL effects) |
| `assets`, `asset_categories`, `depreciation_runs`, `depreciation_lines`, `asset_disposals`, `asset_revaluations` | `fixed_assets` |
| `notes`, `note_events` | `notes` |
| `installment_plans`, `installment_lines` | `installments` |
| `employees`, `salary_structures`, `salary_components`, `payroll_runs`, `payroll_run_lines`, `employee_loans`, `employee_loan_lines` | `payroll` |
| `budgets`, `budget_lines` | `budgeting` |
| `consolidation_groups`, `group_entities`, `elimination_entries`, `consolidation_runs` | `consolidation` (eliminations reach the ledger only through the posting engine, in the parent's consolidation books — ADR-0018; member books never written) |

## In-process events (side effects, not the record)

| Event | Emitted by | Handled by |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| `invoice.posted` | sales | notifications, reporting (cache invalidation) |
| `invoice.overdue` | sales (job) | notifications |
| `stock.below_reorder` | inventory | notifications |
| `tenant.suspended` | tenancy | identity (sessions), sync (device push rejection) |
| `einvoice.submission.failed` | tax adapter | notifications |
| `sync.push.rejected` | sync | notifications |

## Rule of thumb for new modules

A new capability becomes a module only if it owns tables and has a distinct vocabulary;
otherwise it is a feature of an existing module. Industry-specific logic lives in
templates + configuration + (rarely) thin adapters — **not** in new modules that duplicate
core domains (directive §3: one accounting engine, industry extensions around it).
