# Accounting Tests

> **Status:** STABLE · **Owner:** Quality Engineering & Accounting Domain · **Updated:** 2026-10-28

The accounting test bible: (a) invariant suite mapping INV-001..INV-026, (b) golden tests
for every canonical posting rule in
[../accounting/POSTING_ENGINE.md](../accounting/POSTING_ENGINE.md) §4 with three fully
worked numeric examples, (c) property tests, (d) reconciliation tests, (e) concurrency
tests, (f) period-close tests. Rules of engagement (assert data, never screenshots;
failure cases mandatory; zero-residue on failure) come from
[TEST_STRATEGY.md](TEST_STRATEGY.md) §3. Invariant definitions:
[../accounting/ACCOUNTING_INVARIANTS.md](../accounting/ACCOUNTING_INVARIANTS.md) — IDs
below are exact.

## 1. Suite layout and conventions

- Suites: `tests/accounting/invariants/` (§2), `tests/accounting/golden/` (§3),
  `tests/accounting/property/` (§4), `tests/accounting/reconciliation/` (§5),
  `tests/accounting/concurrency/` (§6), `tests/accounting/periods/` (§7).
- Harness: real PostgreSQL via Testcontainers (`erp_app` role, RLS on); posting through
  module services exactly as production code paths do — **no direct journal inserts**.
- Amounts: `NUMERIC(19,4)`; assertions compare exact decimals, tolerance **0.00**
  (reconciliation rules, [../accounting/RECONCILIATION.md](../accounting/RECONCILIATION.md) §2).
- Every golden test asserts: journal lines (purpose, direction, doc+base amount), GL
  balances, subledger effects, source-document state (`POSTED`, `postedJournalId`), and an
  audit event.
- Every failure test asserts the typed error code **and zero residue**: no journal rows,
  no subledger rows, document state unchanged, no sequence consumed for the document type
  where the engine assigns numbers only on success.

## 2. Invariant suite mapping (INV-001..INV-026)

| ID | Positive scenario (must hold) | Violation attempt (must fail, typed) | Test file |
|----|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| INV-001 | Balanced spec posts: Σdebit=Σcredit in document currency, 0 tolerance | Spec off by 0.0001 → `ENTRY_NOT_BALANCED`, zero residue | `invariants/INV-001.spec.ts` |
| INV-002 | FX entry balances in base currency (per-line conversion) | Line-level FX rounding drift → engine rejects (caller must pre-balance) | `invariants/INV-002.spec.ts` |
| INV-003 | Posted entry: UPDATE via repository guard → error; direct SQL UPDATE/DELETE as `erp_app` → 0 rows/trigger error; repeat after simulated restore drill | Attempted UPDATE of a posted line, DELETE of entry | `invariants/INV-003.spec.ts` |
| INV-004 | Posting to active leaf account succeeds | Group (non-leaf) account → `ACCOUNT_NOT_POSTABLE`; archived → `ACCOUNT_ARCHIVED` | `invariants/INV-004.spec.ts` |
| INV-005 | SAR-restricted account accepts SAR line | Same account + USD line → `CURRENCY_MISMATCH` | `invariants/INV-005.spec.ts` |
| INV-006 | Posted invoice references journal entries and vice versa (`source` chain complete) | Attempt to mark document `POSTED` with zero journal entries (service-level sabotage) → impossible by API; integration asserts chain after every golden post | `invariants/INV-006.spec.ts` |
| INV-007 | Line tax + line nets + header totals reconcile exactly; residual → rounding purpose line | Feed amounts engineered to round unevenly (e.g., 3 lines × 33.333…): residual must appear as explicit rounding line, never dropped | `invariants/INV-007.spec.ts` |
| INV-008 | FX entry stores rate>0 and base = doc × rate exactly as stored | Missing rate → `MISSING_FX_RATE`; rate ≤ 0 → `INVALID_AMOUNT`; re-read returns stored values, no recomputation drift | `invariants/INV-008.spec.ts` |
| INV-009 | AR/AP lines carry partner; Σ partner subledger (base) = control account balance across 20 randomized ops | AR line without partner → `MISSING_PARTNER_ON_CONTROL`; seeded subledger drift detected by job (see §5) | `invariants/INV-009.spec.ts` |
| INV-010 | Σ(qty×valuation) over stock ledger = inventory account balance after each golden inventory op | Seeded orphan stock move (no journal) → reconciliation `BROKEN` (drift test §5) | `invariants/INV-010.spec.ts` |
| INV-011 | Entry in OPEN period posts | Entry dated in LOCKED period → `PERIOD_LOCKED` (engine) AND trigger double-check fires on direct insert attempt | `invariants/INV-011.spec.ts` |
| INV-012 | Per period Σ document tax summaries by treatment = GL tax-account movements | Seeded summary/GL mismatch → VAT return reconciliation flags (§5) | `invariants/INV-012.spec.ts` |
| INV-013 | Same `(tenant, source_type, source_id, operation)` posted twice sequentially → second returns original result, no new entry | Retry after success + concurrent duplicate (§6) → one entry only | `invariants/INV-013.spec.ts` |
| INV-014 | `reverse()` mirrors accounts/partners/items/amounts, links both ways; original marked `REVERSED` | Reverse twice → `ALREADY_REVERSED`; reverse a non-POSTED entry → error; mirror mismatch impossible by construction (assert full mirror) | `invariants/INV-014.spec.ts` |
| INV-015 | Delete account without postings/children succeeds (archival flow) | Delete account with postings → blocked; archive required-purpose mapped account → blocked | `invariants/INV-015.spec.ts` |
| INV-016 | Allocations ≤ receipt amount; document allocated total ≤ total | Over-allocation attempt (allocate 500 on 300 receipt; allocate beyond invoice total) → rejected, both sides unchanged | `invariants/INV-016.spec.ts` |
| INV-017 | Method switch runs dated revaluation posting; past issues keep original costs | Switch without revaluation/attempts to retro-restate → rejected; history query returns original issue costs | `invariants/INV-017.spec.ts` |
| INV-018 | Every stock move has its journal in the same transaction (or policy-none for same-account transfer) | Simulated crash between move and journal (test double aborts mid-transaction) → rollback leaves **neither**; move-without-journal impossible via API | `invariants/INV-018.spec.ts` |
| INV-019 | Cash account balance = Σ its treasury movements after receipts/payments/transfers/shifts | Seeded drift (movement row without ledger effect) → reconciliation `BROKEN` | `invariants/INV-019.spec.ts` |
| INV-020 | Reopen requires `accounting.periods.reopen` + reason; audit event written; subsequent posting revalidates all invariants | Reopen without permission → 403; reopen without reason → 400; missing audit event fails test | `invariants/INV-020.spec.ts` |
| INV-021 | Official numbers unique per (tenant, type, branch); voided numbers stay reserved | Two invoices racing for same number (§6); reuse of a voided number → rejected | `invariants/INV-021.spec.ts` |
| INV-022 | Fuzz: flip entitlements/templates/feature flags mid-dataset → posting math identical; no config path disables any invariant check | Fuzz corpus of 50 config permutations against golden dataset → byte-identical journals | `invariants/INV-022.spec.ts` |
| INV-023 | Asset depreciation stays within the floor: after every run Σ depreciation ≤ cost − salvage_value and NBV ≥ 0; disposal only once, only from ACTIVE/FULLY_DEPRECIATED | Depreciation engineered to cross the floor (method/period override) → `NBV_BELOW_SALVAGE`, run rejected zero-residue; second disposal of the same asset → `ASSET_ALREADY_DISPOSED`; disposal from DISPOSED/WRITTEN_OFF status → `ASSET_NOT_DISPOSABLE` | `invariants/INV-023.spec.ts` |
| INV-024 | COLLECTED/DISCOUNTED/RETURNED note carries zero `NOTES_RECEIVABLE` balance; DISHONORED note restores the AR open item exactly (amount + references) | Dishonor fixture with amount/reference drift vs the original open item → `DISHONOR_MISMATCH`, rejected zero-residue; collected note seeded with a residual balance → note-custody reconciliation `BROKEN` (diff row lists the note) | `invariants/INV-024.spec.ts` |
| INV-025 | Payroll run totals = Σ lines (gross, deductions, net); net = gross − deductions exactly (0 tolerance); posted runs immutable (reversal-only) | Seeded line-sum drift → run rejected before post; UPDATE/DELETE on a posted run as `erp_app` → 0 rows / trigger error; API edit-after-post impossible — reversal + new run only | `invariants/INV-025.spec.ts` |
| INV-026 | Consolidation run writes zero rows to member books; consolidated statement = Σ member statements (group currency, dated FX) − eliminations; eliminations are balanced journals in the consolidation books | Cross-tenant write attempt through the run service → rejected by the read-only consolidation role + RLS (0 rows); member-book hash identical before/after run; unbalanced elimination spec → `ENTRY_NOT_BALANCED` | `invariants/INV-026.spec.ts` |

## 3. Posting golden tests (canonical rule per [POSTING_ENGINE.md](../accounting/POSTING_ENGINE.md) §4)

Seed conventions: mapped purposes `AR_CONTROL, AP_CONTROL, SALES_REVENUE, SALES_RETURNS,
VAT_PAYABLE, VAT_RECOVERABLE, COGS, INVENTORY, INVENTORY_SHRINKAGE,
INVENTORY_APPRECIATION, GRNI, WIP, PRODUCTION_SCRAP, CASH, PETTY_CASH, BANK_CHARGES,
FX_GAIN, FX_LOSS, ROUNDING_GAIN, ROUNDING_LOSS, RETAINED_EARNINGS, CLOSING, OPENING_EQUITY`;
per-document expense lines post to accounts chosen on the document (no purpose mapping).
`S` = seeded quantity/amount; amounts below are formulas unless the worked example fixes
them. Every row additionally runs the standard failure pack: locked period
(`PERIOD_LOCKED`), unmapped purpose (`PURPOSE_NOT_MAPPED`), unbalanced spec
(`ENTRY_NOT_BALANCED`), already-posted (`ALREADY_POSTED`) — all with zero-residue asserts.

**v2.0 goldens (G-21…G-32)** additionally map the module-conditional purposes per
[../accounting/CHART_OF_ACCOUNTS.md](../accounting/CHART_OF_ACCOUNTS.md) §2 and
[../EXPANSION_REGISTER.md](../EXPANSION_REGISTER.md) §E — `FIXED_ASSET` (per category
account), `ACCUM_DEPRECIATION`, `DEPRECIATION_EXPENSE`, `ASSET_DISPOSAL_GAIN` /
`ASSET_DISPOSAL_LOSS`, `REVALUATION_RESERVE`, `NOTES_RECEIVABLE`, `NOTES_PAYABLE`,
`NOTES_DISCOUNT_EXPENSE`, `LATE_FEE_INCOME`, `SALARIES_EXPENSE`, `SALARIES_PAYABLE`,
`DEDUCTIONS_PAYABLE`, `EMPLOYER_CONTRIBUTIONS`, `EOS_PROVISION`, `EOS_PROVISION_EXPENSE`,
`CONSOLIDATION_ADJUSTMENT` — run the same standard failure pack, and assert the
source-document state per §1 (`POSTED` + `postedJournalId`/`journal_entry_id` + audit
event); module-level rejection codes are asserted in the INV-023…INV-026 suites (§2).

### 3.1 Worked example W-1 — credit sales invoice, KSA 15% VAT

**Seed**: base currency SAR; purposes mapped; partner "شركة النور" (credit); Item A:
on-hand 20 @ WAC 60.0000; Item B: on-hand 10 @ WAC 25.0000; prices A=100.00, B=40.00;
tax code STD15 (standard 15%).

**Action**: post credit invoice SAL-000042, lines: (A ×10 @100.00 = 1,000.0000),
(B ×5 @40.00 = 200.0000). Net 1,200.0000; VAT 180.0000; total 1,380.0000.

**Expected journal — AR entry (`sales_invoice:post`)**:

| Line | Purpose | Direction | Amount (SAR) |
|------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | AR_CONTROL (partner النور) | debit | 1,380.0000 |
| 2 | SALES_REVENUE | credit | 1,200.0000 |
| 3 | VAT_PAYABLE (code STD15) | credit | 180.0000 |

**Expected journal — COGS entry (`sales_invoice:cogs`)**:

| Line | Purpose | Direction | Amount (SAR) |
|------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | COGS | debit | 725.0000 |
| 2 | INVENTORY | credit | 725.0000 |

**Subledger/effects asserts**: partner AR open +1,380.0000; stock moves A −10 @60.0000,
B −5 @25.0000; on-hand A=10, B=5 with unchanged WAC; balances: AR 1,380.0000, revenue
1,200.0000, VAT payable 180.0000, COGS 725.0000, inventory −725.0000; INV-010
reconciliation green; official number SAL-000042 assigned, unique, immutable (INV-021).

**Failure pack on this fixture**: post again → `ALREADY_POSTED` (INV-013); lock the
period then post a twin invoice → `PERIOD_LOCKED`; unmap VAT_PAYABLE →
`PURPOSE_NOT_MAPPED`; corrupt spec (line 2 = 1,199.0000) → `ENTRY_NOT_BALANCED` — each
with zero residue.

### 3.2 Worked example W-2 — receipt with FX gain

**Seed**: base SAR. Invoice SAL-000077 posted earlier: 1,000.0000 USD credit at rate
3.7500 → journal stored base amounts: DR AR_CONTROL 3,750.0000 (rate recorded on entry,
INV-008). Partner open amount 1,000.0000 USD.

**Action**: receipt RCP-000010 for 1,000.0000 USD into bank account at current rate
3.7600; allocate fully to SAL-000077.

**Expected journal (`receipt:post`)**:

| Line | Purpose | Direction | Doc (USD) | Base (SAR) |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | CASH | debit | 1,000.0000 | 3,760.0000 |
| 2 | AR_CONTROL (partner) | credit | 1,000.0000 | 3,750.0000 (original stored rate) |
| 3 | FX_GAIN | credit | — | 10.0000 (explicit residual) |

**Asserts**: entry balanced in both currencies (INV-001/002); rate>0 stored (INV-008);
invoice open amount 0.0000 USD; allocation total = invoice total (INV-016); partner
subledger settles 1,000.0000 USD; bank account = Σ movements (INV-019); FX gain appears
in the period's income statement lines.

**Mirror case**: rate 3.7400 → line 3 becomes DR FX_LOSS 10.0000 and cash 3,740.0000 —
asserted by the same test with a second fixture.

### 3.3 Worked example W-3 — credit note with stock return

**Seed**: W-1's posted invoice SAL-000042 (A ×10 @100.00). Customer returns 2 units of A
(damaged). WAC of A still 60.0000; original issue cost for the returned units = 60.0000.

**Action**: post credit note CN-000005: line A qty 2 @100.0000 = 200.0000 net; VAT 15% =
30.0000; credit total 230.0000; flag = return-to-stock.

**Expected journal — credit-note entry (`credit_note:post`)**:

| Line | Purpose | Direction | Amount (SAR) |
|------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | SALES_RETURNS (contra revenue) | debit | 200.0000 |
| 2 | VAT_PAYABLE (STD15) | debit | 30.0000 |
| 3 | AR_CONTROL (partner النور) | credit | 230.0000 |

**Expected journal — stock re-entry**:

| Line | Purpose | Direction | Amount (SAR) |
|------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | INVENTORY | debit | 120.0000 (2 × original cost 60.0000 — **not** current-average recompute) |
| 2 | COGS | credit | 120.0000 |

**Asserts**: partner AR open reduced by 230.0000 (or credit balance if already settled);
stock A +2 @60.0000 (reason RETURN, batch preserved); gross-margin report shows return at
original cost (COGS net 605.0000 for the original sale after this pair); INV-009/010/012
all green on the reconciliation run; the credit note references SAL-000042 (source chain,
INV-006).

## 4. Property tests (fast-check)

| Property | Generator | Invariant assertion |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| Rounding monotonicity | arbitrary line amounts at 2–4 decimals, split counts 2..50 | rounded(line sums) ≤ rounded(total) rounding direction consistent; Σ residuals = explicit rounding lines; re-rounding never changes result (idempotent) |
| Line-net/tax/header conservation | random nets + rates (0%, 5%, 14%, 15%) | Σ line tax = header tax; Σ line net = header net — INV-007, always exact |
| WAC recalculation | random receipt sequences (qty>0, cost>0) onto existing stock | new average strictly within [min(costs seen), max(costs seen)]; qtyOnHand × avg = valuation total within 6-decimal rounding; issue-then-receipt never mutates past issue costs (INV-017) |
| FIFO layer conservation | random issues/receipts | Σ layer qty = on-hand qty exactly; consumption order = oldest-first always; layers never negative; valuation = Σ layer qty×cost (INV-010) |
| FX base conversion | random doc amounts + rates | base = doc × rate exactly as stored; Σ base debits = Σ base credits when doc balanced (INV-002/008) |
| Allocation bounds | random partial allocations | allocated total never exceeds receipt amount nor invoice total at ANY interleaving (INV-016) |

## 5. Reconciliation tests (subledger vs control — INV-009/010/012 + drift detection)

| Test | Arrangement | Expected |
|------|-------------|----------|
| RC-01 (INV-009 AR) | 20 randomized AR ops (invoices, receipts, credit notes, allocations) | job result `OK`; Σ partner subledger = AR_CONTROL exactly |
| RC-02 (INV-009 AP) | mirror AP scenario | `OK` exact |
| RC-03 (INV-009 **drift**) | seed one partner-subledger row deleted (simulated corruption) | job result `BROKEN` with diff row listing the partner + amount; notification fired; period close blocked ([../accounting/RECONCILIATION.md](../accounting/RECONCILIATION.md) §3) |
| RC-04 (INV-010) | mixed inventory ops incl. transfer-without-journal case and landed cost | `OK`; Σ qty×valuation = INVENTORY account(s) per branch split |
| RC-05 (INV-010 **drift**) | insert orphan stock_move without journal (test tooling, not app code) | `BROKEN` with offending move id |
| RC-06 (INV-012) | period with standard/zero-rated/exempt mix (per-pack fixtures) | Σ document tax summaries by treatment = GL movements of VAT_PAYABLE/RECOVERABLE/EXPENSED; VAT return draft shows both sides equal |
| RC-07 (INV-012 **drift**) | mutate one document tax summary row | mismatch blocks "file" status of the return draft |
| RC-08 (INV-019) | treasury ops incl. transfers, fees, shift differences | every cash/bank balance = Σ movements |
| RC-09 (GRNI) | GRN without supplier invoice → invoice → partial | GRNI register = GRNI account at each step |
| RC-10 (determinism) | run statement/aging twice as-of same date | byte-identical results (no caching drift) |

## 6. Concurrency tests

| Test | Scenario | Expected |
|------|----------|----------|
| CC-01 Duplicate posting, same invoice | two parallel `post()` calls for the same source (two API requests, same idempotency semantics) | exactly ONE journal entry set; the loser returns the stored result (INV-013); no unique-violation leaks to the user; no partial subledger |
| CC-02 Concurrent receipts allocating to one invoice | two receipts allocate against the same invoice's open amount simultaneously | final allocated total ≤ invoice total (INV-016); one allocation may be partially accepted; no negative open amount ever |
| CC-03 Sequence numbering race | 50 parallel invoice posts in one branch | 50 unique official numbers, no gaps-collisions, INV-021; per-tenant sequence contention does not deadlock (assert with statement-timeout headroom) |
| CC-04 Stock issue race | two concurrent sales issuing the last 10 units | stock never negative (default policy): one wins, one fails `INSUFFICIENT_STOCK` cleanly (no ledger residue for the loser) |
| CC-05 Period lock race | post() racing a period LOCK command | either the entry commits before lock or gets `PERIOD_LOCKED`; never a posted entry inside a locked period (INV-011) |
| CC-06 Reversal vs re-post | reverse() racing a duplicate delivery of the original post command | at most one entry + at most one reversal (INV-013/014 interplay) |

## 7. Period-close tests

| Test | Scenario | Expected |
|------|----------|----------|
| PC-01 Lock enforcement | lock a period; attempt invoice post, manual journal, adjustment, reopen-less everything | all rejected `PERIOD_LOCKED` (engine); direct SQL insert into locked period blocked by trigger (INV-011) |
| PC-02 Soft-close discipline | soft-closed period + `accounting.periods.post_to_soft_closed` + reason | posting succeeds with audit; without permission/reason → rejected |
| PC-03 Reopen audit (INV-020) | reopen locked period with permission+reason | audit event with actor/reason; subsequent posting revalidates invariants normally; reopen of period older than 2 months raises anti-fraud alert ([../accounting/PERIOD_CLOSING.md](../accounting/PERIOD_CLOSING.md) §2) |
| PC-04 Close checklist gates | attempt LOCK with a BROKEN reconciliation (seeded RC-03) | lock refused until reconciliations green or explicitly waived per workflow |
| PC-05 Year-end correctness | seeded year: revenues R=10,000, expenses E=7,500 (multiple accounts) | closing entry: DR revenue accounts 10,000 · CR CLOSING 10,000; DR CLOSING 7,500 · CR expense accounts 7,500; DR CLOSING 2,500 · CR RETAINED_EARNINGS 2,500 — one entry, source `year_end_close`, net = prior-year IS net |
| PC-06 Year-end reversibility | reverse the closing entry (`year_end_close:reverse`) then regenerate | counter-entry mirrors exactly (INV-014); regenerated entry idempotent per year (INV-013); prior-year statements unchanged by the whole cycle |
| PC-07 Prior-year immutability | after year N close, post corrections in N+1 | statements of N never change; N+1 memo/disclosure path works; no restatement back-door |

## 8. Per-pack expansion rule

Every jurisdiction pack ships its own golden fixture pack (rates, treatments, invoice
requirements) — a pack without green posting-golden + VAT-return tests cannot be enabled
for tenants ([../localization/TAX_ENGINE.md](../localization/TAX_ENGINE.md) adapter
framework). Test names carry the pack id, e.g. `golden/pack-sa/G-01-credit-invoice-15pct`.

## 9. Maintenance protocol

1. New posting rule (new operation in POSTING_ENGINE.md §4) ⇒ new G-row here + golden
   test + failure pack, same PR.
2. New invariant ⇒ row in §2 test-first (ACCOUNTING_INVARIANTS.md protocol).
3. New jurisdiction pack ⇒ §8 fixture pack before tenant enablement.
4. Any drift incident (RISK-009) adds a seeded-drift test named after the incident ticket
   ([REGRESSION_STRATEGY.md](REGRESSION_STRATEGY.md) §5).
