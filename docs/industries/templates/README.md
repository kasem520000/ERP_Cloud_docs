# Industry Template Manifests — Index

> **Status:** STABLE · **Owner:** Industry Solutions Architecture · **Updated:** 2026-10-27

The eight first-party industry templates, one manifest per business activity family. Each
template document in this folder contains: the JSON manifest (following the schema in
[../README.md](../README.md) §3), target businesses, exact feature keys, sample navigation
(AR + EN), terminology overrides, the signature workflow, inventory defaults, emphasized
document types and reports, and explicit out-of-scope/limitations.

## Index

> **Canonical template identity (consolidation DEF-008, 2026-10-28):** the machine key is
> the manifest `"id"` (`industry.*`), resolved by the configuration engine; the filenames
> below are documentation slugs only. Machine-readable manifests are extracted to
> [`manifests/`](manifests/) (one `manifest.<family>.json` per template, JSON-validated by
> `scripts/extract_manifests.py`; regenerate after editing any embedded manifest).

| Machine id (canonical) | Manifest JSON | Document | Industries served | Phase | Key differentiators |
|------------------------|---------------|----------|-------------------|-------|---------------------|
| `industry.retail` | [manifest.retail.json](manifests/manifest.retail.json) | [retail.md](retail.md) | Clothing, electronics, mobile phones, cosmetics, general retail stores | PHASE-015 | Barcode counter POS, IMEI register for phones, variant-style items, exchanges/returns, branch transfers |
| `industry.grocery` | [manifest.grocery.json](manifests/manifest.grocery.json) | [grocery-supermarket.md](grocery-supermarket.md) | Grocery, convenience stores, supermarkets, wholesale food retail | PHASE-015 | Scale-barcode weighed items, batch/expiry with FEFO, expiry write-off discipline, customer price tiers |
| `industry.restaurant` | [manifest.restaurant.json](manifests/manifest.restaurant.json) | [restaurant-cafe.md](restaurant-cafe.md) | Restaurants, cafés, buffets, bakeries with retail counters | PHASE-015 | Table service, order types, combos, fast check flow, daily Z close, kitchen ticket routing |
| `industry.automotive` | [manifest.automotive.json](manifests/manifest.automotive.json) | [automotive-workshop.md](automotive-workshop.md) | Tire shops, spare-parts stores, repair workshops (combined or standalone) | PHASE-017 | Job cards combining parts + labor, per-customer vehicle registry, diagnosis quotations, service history |
| `industry.distribution` | [manifest.distribution.json](manifests/manifest.distribution.json) | [distribution-field-sales.md](distribution-field-sales.md) | Van-sales distributors, beverage/food routes, wholesale with field reps | PHASE-017 | Routes, van stock, rep settlements with variance, price tiers, free goods, field collections |
| `industry.food_manufacturing` | [manifest.food_manufacturing.json](manifests/manifest.food_manufacturing.json) | [food-manufacturing.md](food-manufacturing.md) | Bakeries, food production lines, packaging operations | PHASE-018 | BOM/recipes, production orders with WIP, QC gate, batch genealogy, shelf-life batches |
| `industry.professional_services` | [manifest.professional_services.json](manifests/manifest.professional_services.json) | [professional-services.md](professional-services.md) | Law offices, consulting, accounting firms, agencies | PHASE-019 | Service contracts, time-based and recurring billing, milestones, project dimension, no stock by default |
| `industry.rental_logistics` | [manifest.rental_logistics.json](manifests/manifest.rental_logistics.json) | [rental-logistics.md](rental-logistics.md) | Car rental, equipment rental, shipping/freight agencies | PHASE-019 | Rental contracts with deposits and late fees, fleet utilization, shipment milestone tracking |

Requirement traceability: retail/grocery/restaurant = FR-IND-002, automotive/distribution =
FR-IND-003, food manufacturing = FR-IND-004, professional services + rental/logistics =
FR-IND-005 in [../../PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md](../../PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md); phase
sequencing per [../../planning/MASTER_ROADMAP.md](../../planning/MASTER_ROADMAP.md)
(stage 6, PHASE-015…019).

## Phase map

| Phase | Delivers |
|-------|----------|
| PHASE-015 | Industry framework (manifest engine, switching rules) + `retail`, `grocery_supermarket`, `restaurant_cafe` templates — POS-flavored entries are phase-gated "coming with PHASE-016" |
| PHASE-016 | Point of sale — un-gates `barcode_pos`, `table_service`, `scale_barcodes`, `cashier_shifts` terminal flows |
| PHASE-017 | `automotive_workshop` + `distribution_field_sales` templates |
| PHASE-018 | `food_manufacturing` template (manufacturing module) |
| PHASE-019 | `professional_services` + `rental_logistics` templates (CRM, contracts, projects) |

## Choosing and combining

- One **active template** per tenant at a time; capabilities from other templates may be
  added individually (a supermarket group with an in-store bakery adds
  `bom_production` when PHASE-018 ships — additive per [../README.md](../README.md) §5).
- Hybrid businesses pick the template matching their **dominant revenue flow** and layer
  optional capabilities (e.g., a tire shop that is 80% parts retail picks
  `automotive_workshop` and switches `barcode_pos` to OPTIONAL→enabled).
- When no template fits, the tenant completes onboarding with platform defaults
  (no template) and composes capabilities manually.

## Adding a new first-party template

1. Write the manifest against the schema ([../README.md](../README.md) §3) and a document
   in this folder using the same section skeleton.
2. Answer all 24 capability columns in
   [../capabilities/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md](../capabilities/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md) for the new
   industry (REQUIRED/OPTIONAL/N/A) — extend the matrix, don't fork it.
3. Pass the seven governance tests ([../README.md](../README.md) §8), including golden
   onboarding and switch-safety fixtures.
4. Register in the platform template registry with semver `1.0.0` and bilingual release
   notes; add signature workflows and reports to
   [../workflows/](../workflows/README.md) and [../reports/README.md](../reports/README.md)
   where the template introduces a new flow.
