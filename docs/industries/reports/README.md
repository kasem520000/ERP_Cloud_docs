# Industry Report Catalog

> **Status:** STABLE · **Owner:** Industry Solutions Architecture · **Updated:** 2026-10-27

Industry-flavored reports are **registry entries over shared data** — every report listed
here implements the shared report contract (parameters, scopes, permissions, currency
handling, drill-down, export, versioning) defined in
[../../reporting/REPORT_CONTRACT.md](../../reporting/REPORT_CONTRACT.md), renders
bilingual RTL-correct output ([../../accounting/POSTING_ENGINE.md](../../accounting/POSTING_ENGINE.md)
adjacent rules in [../../accounting/INVENTORY_ACCOUNTING.md](../../accounting/INVENTORY_ACCOUNTING.md) §7),
and reconciles to the ledger wherever it touches financial figures.

Report keys follow the `module.report_name` convention (module = providing module from
[../../architecture/MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md](../../architecture/MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md)); the
canonical report registry lives with the reporting module (PHASE-013 engine; industry
entries register as their phases ship).

Shared financial and operational reports (trial balance, AR/AP aging, stock valuation,
customer/supplier statements) belong to the core reporting catalog and are available to
every industry; they are not repeated here.

## Rules for industry reports

1. **Contract compliance.** Parameters, permission scoping, currency, drill-down to source
   documents, and export formats come from the shared contract — no bespoke report
   frameworks per industry.
2. **Ledger reconciliation.** Any report presenting monetary totals that exist in the GL
   (write-offs, COGS, revenue) shows its GL tie-out or is explicitly labeled operational
   (INV-012 discipline).
3. **Phase discipline.** A report's phase matches the phase of its source data's module —
   e.g., `distribution.rep_settlement` cannot exist before PHASE-017 settlements; it is
   registered at that phase, not before.
4. **Bilingual RTL.** Every industry report ships with AR and EN titles, headers, and
   print templates; Arabic numerals and date formats follow tenant locale settings.
5. **Addition process.** New industry reports: define key + source tables + phase, register
   in the reporting registry, implement against the contract, add to the relevant
   template's `report_defaults`, and cover with a fixture asserting totals against journal
   lines where applicable.
