# Product Requirements

> **Status:** STABLE · **Owner:** Product & Platform Architecture · **Updated:** 2026-10-27

This document is the consolidated requirements baseline. Detailed feature behavior lives in
the [../product/FEATURE_CATALOG.md](product/FEATURE_CATALOG.md) (canonical feature keys);
industry behavior in [../industries/](industries/README.md); compliance behavior in
[../localization/](localization/COUNTRY_PACKS.md). Requirement IDs below are normative and
are referenced by phase documents.

## 3. Constraints

- PostgreSQL is the primary database ([ADR-0004](architecture/ADR/ADR-0004-postgresql-drizzle.md)).
- TypeScript end-to-end ([ADR-0002](architecture/ADR/ADR-0002-typescript-monorepo.md)).
- No microservices, event sourcing, or distributed databases without a documented justification ([ADR-0001](architecture/ADR/ADR-0001-modular-monolith.md)).

  ([../localization/compliance-matrix/](localization/compliance-matrix/README.md)).
- The server is authoritative for all posted financial records ([ADR-0007](architecture/ADR/ADR-0007-centralized-posting-engine.md), [ADR-0012](architecture/ADR/ADR-0012-offline-sync.md)).

## 4. Open requirements

Ambiguities and pending product-owner decisions are recorded with recommended provisional
decisions in [ASSUMPTIONS_AND_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md](ASSUMPTIONS_AND_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md) and
decision records under [../decisions/](decisions/README.md). No requirement in this document
depends on an unresolved decision being resolved in a particular way.
