/**
 * Dependency rules for the ERP monorepo.
 * Source of truth: docs/architecture/DEPENDENCY_RULES.md
 *
 * Client rules (§3) are enforced from PHASE-001. API module-layer rules (§1) match
 * zero files while no module folders exist and activate mechanically as the
 * `apps/api/src/modules/<module>/{domain,application,infrastructure,api,presentation}`
 * folders appear in later phases — no config change is needed then.
